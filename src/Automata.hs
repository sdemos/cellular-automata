-- So, it's difficult to display an infinite field of cells
-- and you don't really need to to get the gist of the automata anyway
-- so instead, we should have a datatype which describes the
-- height and width of the output, the universe to act on, and the rule
-- For one dimensional automata, width is what we pass to toList
-- and height is the number of iterations
